## Mascot personalities

Each mascot represents a coding style based on tool usage patterns, language preferences, response times, and error rates. The eight mascots are: Beaver (builder), Hawk (precision), Owl (wisdom), Cheetah (speed), Octopus (multitasker), Parrot (communicator), Fox (clever), Bear (steady).
